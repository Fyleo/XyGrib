----------------------------------------------------------------------
These instructions are for building XyGrib 1.1.0 on Linux platforms.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1 - Prerequisite tools:
----------------------------
- gnu build tools: g++, make, build-essential etc.
- cmake (needed to build libopenjpeg provided in this package)

Step 2 - Prerequisite libraries:
--------------------------------
The following libraries need to be installed first
(If your Linux system is not one of the three below then other naming
conventions for these packages may apply)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ubuntu 18.04        Fedora 28        openSUSE**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- libbz2-dev        bzip2-devel      libbz2-devel
- zlib1g-dev        zlib-devel       zlib-devel
- libpng-dev *      libpng-devel *   libpng-devel *
- libproj-dev       proj-devel       libproj-devel
- libnova-dev       libnova-devel    libnova-devel
- qtbase5-dev       qt5-devel        libqt5-qtbase-devel
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

* version >= 1.6 needed to build libopenjpeg
** TumbleWeed

Step 3 - Additional prerequisite libraries provided in the XyGrib package:
---------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT! XyGrib uses a modified version of libg2c that uses openjpeg
instead of libjasper. This eliminates conflicts with libjasper in newer
linux distributions. Hence libg2c and libopenjpeg are provided here.

To build libopenjpeg and libg2c please perform the following steps:
--------------------
	cd src/openjpeg-2.3.0
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
	make
	sudo make install
	
	cd ../../g2clib-1.6.0
	sudo make install
	cd ../..
--------------------

Make sure that you are back in the package root

---------------------------------------------------------
Step 4 - Build XyGrib after all above has been completed:
---------------------------------------------------------
Edit the first line in the Makefile so that the QMAKE variable points to the
folder with qmake on your system. 
(For openSuse Tumbleweed and Fedora 28 this should be /usr/lib64/qt5/bin/qmake)

In the package root (where this file is located) execute:
----------------
	make

	make install

-----------------
A folder XyGrib which includes the application build will be located in
your user root. Run 

ENJOY!
