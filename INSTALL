----------------------------------------------------------------------
These install instructions are for building XyGrib on Linux platforms.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Prerequisite tools:
--------------------
- gnu build tools: g++, make, build-essential etc.
- cmake (needed to build libopenjpeg provided in this package)

Prerequisite libraries:
-----------------------
The following libraries need to be installed first
- libbz2-dev
- zlib1g-dev
- libproj-dev
- libnova-dev
- libpng16-dev (version >= 1.6 needed to build libopenjpeg)
- qtbase5-dev
- qt5-default

Prerequisite libraries provided in the package:
----------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT! XyGrib uses a modified version of libg2c that uses openjpeg
instead of libjasper. This eliminates conflicts with libjasper in newer
linux distributions. Hence libg2c and libopenjpeg are provided here.

To build libopenjpeg and libg2c please run the included batch file
"linux_build_3rd_party_libs.sh".

Note: you may be asked to provide your sudo password to allow lib
installation of these two libraries to complete.

---------------------------------------------------
To build XyGrib after all above has been completed:
---------------------------------------------------

In the package root (where this file is located) execute:
------
make

make install

-------------
A folder XyGrib which includes the application build will be located in
your user root.

ENJOY!
